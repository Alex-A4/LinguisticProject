Olenka, the daughter of the retired collegiate assessor, Plemyanniakov, was sitting in her backporch, lost in thought. It was hot, the flies were persistent and teasing, and it was pleasant to reflect that it would soon be evening. <metaphor>Dark rainclouds were gathering from the east, and bringing from time to time a breath of moisture in the air</metaphor>.

"Well, rain away, then! Flood the garden, drown me! Damn my luck in this world and the next! Let the artists have me up! <detachment>Send me to prison! -- to Siberia! -- the scaffold!</detachment> <onomatopoeia>Ha, ha, ha</onomatopoeia>!"

The house in which she had lived from her birth upwards, and which was left her in her father's will, was at the extreme end of the town, not far from the Tivoli. In the evenings and at night she could head the band playing, and the crackling and banging of fireworks, and it seemed to her that it was Kukin struggling with his destiny, storming the entrenchments of his chief foe, the indifferent public; there was a sweet thrill at her heart, she had no desire to sleep, and when he returned home at day break, she tapped softly at her bedroom window, and showing him only her face and one shoulder through the curtain, she gave him a friendly smile ... He proposed to her, and they were married. And when he had a closer view of her neck and her plump, fine shoulders, he threw up his hands, and said:
